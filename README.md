# SampleProjects
Projects I enjoyed working on.  

The Nucleic acid tool was the first project I worked on before begining the software guild.  I would like to rework it using dynamic html to display multiple potential reading frames, and realtime display of reverse compliment sequences via either angular or react.  

The private library app is an ongoing project to create an app to manage my family's collection of books.  Since it is something entirely for fun/personal use, the UI will probably be the very last thing I work on.  

The other two projects are course work from the software guild that utilize dependency injection, file IO, jQuery and Ajax, and REST services.
