This is the first independent project I undertook, before joining the software guild.  I was curious to see if I could make a DNA analysis tool similar to a molecular biology tool I used as a biologist.   Given time I would like to:
1) Reconfigure to allow for the display of multiple potential open reading frames via jquery implementation
2) Redo frontend using either angular or react framework
